super-analyzer
==============

The Super Analyzer analyzes your iTunes music library and gives you interesting statistics. For example, visually see how many songs you have in each genre or from each decade, or see what time of day you listen most often.

To compile the source code, just create a new project in Eclipse, add the src files, add external jar references to the 3 jar files and run as a Java Applicatioin using the main() method in the net.nosleep package.
